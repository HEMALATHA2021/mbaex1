#Procedure:

    ##WEKA is the acronym for Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis. WEKA, an open-source tool, designed and developed by the researchers at the University of Waikato, New Zealand, currently distributed under the free GNU GPL license.

    ##WEKA is fully developed in Java. It provides integration with the SQL database using Java Database connectivity (JDBC). It provides many Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to implement data mining tasks. These algorithms can either be used directly using the WEKA tool. It provides data preprocessing, classification, clustering, regression analysis, association rule creation, feature extraction, and data visualization tools in abundance. Thus it is a powerful tool that supports the development of new algorithms in machine learning.

    ##With WEKA, the machine learning algorithms are readily available to the users. The ML specialists can use these methods to extract useful insights from high volumes of data. Users can create an environment to develop new machine learning methods and implement them on state of the art data. Henceforth serves the learning purpose and attracts machine learning and applied sciences researchers. 

#Installation Steps:

##1) Download the software from the website (https://sourceforge.net/projects/weka/)
Check the configuration of the computer system and download the stable version of WEKA.
